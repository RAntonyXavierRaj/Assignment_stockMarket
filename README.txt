1. The following project is a simple model of a stock market.
2. The main object is marketIndex() and stock() objects are created under the marketIndex.
3. The trade() objects are created under the stocks.
4. For a given price, the calculateDividendYield() function calculates dividend yield.
5. For a given price, the priceToEarningsRatio() function calculates PE ratio.
6. The volumeWeightedStockPrice() function calculates Volume Weighted Stock Price, by using the trade information in each stock.
7. The allShareIndex() function calculates GBCE all share index, by using the final prices of each stock.

unittest (integrationTest.py)
*****************************

1. I faced some problems while doing integration testing using unittest package.
2. So I have submitted my half worked test file with the project with few errors.
3. But the main code (main.py) has no errors and main.py runs correctly.
